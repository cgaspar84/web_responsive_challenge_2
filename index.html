                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Ken Sugimore was born on January 27, 1966 in Tokyo, Japan. In the early to mid 1980s, he worked as an
                    illustrator for the gaming magazine Game Freak. He then worked on the arcade game Mendel Palace,
                    which was released in 1989. </p>
                <p>He is mostly best known as the primary character designed and art director for the Pokemon franchise.
                    Sugimori drew and finalized all of the original 151 Pokemon. He also worked as illustrator for the
                    Pokemon Trading Card game, as well as Pokemon films, and other games like the Super Smash Bros.
                    series. He currently works as a director for The Pokemon Company</p>

                <h2>His work</h2>
                <p>Sugimori has been creating marveolous art throughout the many years of Pokemon history. On the 25th
                    anniversary of the saga, he celebrated with the Pokemon community by publishing a book filled with
                    his artwork that he has been doing through the tiemline of the franchise. </p>

                <h2>His drawing style</h2>
                <p>With the years, his drawing style has varied greatly. </p>
                <p>On his first designs for the Pokemon franchise it is remarkable to note the use of more faded colors
                    on his official artwork pieces, with characters sporting a more pale skin. The illumination on them
                    is very simple, yet giving them a very unique lovely and cozy flair to them. This cozy and simple
                    style really is remarkable to look at, even when body details were not so much detailed as it is on
                    more of his recent artworks. For example the artwork for Red, the main protagonist of the first
                    Pokemon games, make him look more younger and smaller than what he really is.</p>
                <p>On more recent artworks of his, his drawing style is much more refined and detailed. The anatomy of
                    characters is much more detailed as well as color depth and shadows. Facial form and expressions,
                    detail of background surroundings like weather or wind moveemnts clearly shows his own evolution as
                    an artist.</p>

                <h2>His creative process</h2>
                <p>When he begins drawing a new character, his process normally implicates the use of an initial sketch
                    or draft. This itinital draft is them polished up to give it a professional look. Once it is done,
                    he decides to redraw the character many more times, changing body proportions or expression until he
                    is fully satisfied with his work.</p>
